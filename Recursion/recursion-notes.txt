Recursion => A function calls itself

*) Any program that can be written iteratively can also be written recursively.

*) Many algorithm techniques are based on recursion.
    => Dynamic Programming
    => Backtracking
    => Divide and Conquer( Binary Search,  Quick sort merge sort)

*) Many problems inherently recursive
    => Tower of Hanoi
    => DFS based traversals (DFS of graph, Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversal of tree);
